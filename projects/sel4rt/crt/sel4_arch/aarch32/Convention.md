# Calling Conventions for AARCH32

* `sp` contains the stack pointer,
* `lr` (link register) contains the return address,
* `a1` to `a4` are used to store the arguments and results of a
  subroutine.

Additionally:

* The stack must always be double-word aligned, i.e. `sp` mod 8 == 0.

# Prologue

1. push the value of `lr` onto the stack,
2. push the value of `fp` onto the stack, then
3. read the current value of `sp` into `fp`.

```asm
stmdb sp!, {fp, lr}
mov fp, sp
```

# Epilogue

```asm
ldmia sp!, {fp, lr}
bx lr
```
